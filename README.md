## 🚀 About The Project

**All LeetCode Contest** is a specialized dashboard designed for competitive programmers and software engineering candidates to practice past LeetCode contests in a focused, distraction-free environment.

Retrieving and organizing past contests on the official platform can be cumbersome. This application provides a streamlined interface to browse, filter, and simulate contests from the entire LeetCode archive.

## 🎯 Improving Candidate Performance

This tool is built to help candidates **ASCEND** in their rankings by solving the core problems of contest practice:

-   **Simulated Pressure**: The built-in **Focus Mode** replicates the 90-minute contest window, helping you build speed and anxiety resilience.
-   **Structured Practice**: Easily filter contests by Year and Month to target specific time periods or recent trends.
-   **Progress Tracking**: View your real-time LeetCode contest rating, global rank, and attendance stats at a glance.
-   **Distraction-Free**: A clean, premium "Dark Mode" UI that keeps you focused on the problems, not the noise.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Real-time Synchonization**: Fetches your live profile stats directly from LeetCode.
-   **Smart Filtering**: Drill down into specific years and months to find relevant problem sets.
-   **Premium UI**: A modern, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
